# Solve Diagonal Sudoku with AI

## Synopsis

In this project we will create an agent to solve _diagonal_ Sudoku puzzles. A diagonal Sudoku puzzle is identical to traditional Sudoku puzzles with the added constraint that the boxes on the two main diagonals of the board must also contain the digits 1-9 in each cell (just like the rows, columns, and 3x3 blocks).

Strategies applied by the agent:

1. Eliminate

2. Only Choice

3. Naked Twins

4. Depth First Search

## Quickstart Guide

1. You can run a small set of test cases using the local test suite.

    `(venv)$ python -m unittest -v`

2. You can run the code with visualization (see the last section of the readme for more information)

    `(venv)$ python solution.py`
